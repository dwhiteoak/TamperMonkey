{"name":"Tampermonkey Scripts","tagline":"","body":"# Welcome to TamperMonkey Scripts for Newcastle University.\r\n### For use with the NUSERVICE - helps to create new incidents and Service Requests quickly and easily\r\n\r\n![Nuservice ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibettison/tamperMonkey/master/NUService.PNG)\r\n\r\n## What is needed to use the scripts\r\n* Install the [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) extension in your Google Chrome Browser\r\n* Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)\r\n* Fork my [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) scripts into your GitHub account (see help (2) below)\r\n* Download [GitHub Desktop Application](https://desktop.github.com/) and install it on your desktop\r\n* Edit _HeaderDetails.user.js_ to reflect your own details (See help (5) below)\r\n* Download the forked copy of my [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) Scripts to the Desktop application (see help (3) below)\r\n* Now in [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) go to Dashboard/Utilities and import from the GitHub location on you Desktop\r\n* Type the following in the URL prompt **File://H:/GitHub/TamperMonkey/setUpButtons.user.js** (this is the default desktop app local folder location for GitHub repositories)\r\n* You now should have an option to install the script - go ahead and click the **Install button**\r\n* The last thing you need to do now is change the path to the Header Details file you edited earlier. Do this by selecting _Dashboard/Installed userscripts_ and click on the script that has now been installed. The script has header details at the top of it and you need to change the path to the following... ( see help (1) below)\r\n\r\n## 1. Change this path in the **setUpButtons** script\r\n// @require      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibettison/tamperMonkey/master/headerDetails.user.js\r\nto\r\n// @require      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{yourGitHubId}/tamperMonkey/master/headerDetails.user.js\r\n\r\n## 2. Fork - I thought that was something to eat with\r\nA fork in GitHub terms is basically making a copy of a repository into your GitHub account. Click on the FORK button when you are in [my account (TamperMonkey)](https://github.com/ibettison/tamperMonkey) \r\n![Click to Fork ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibettison/tamperMonkey/master/Fork.PNG)\r\n\r\nYou now have a copy of the TamperMonkey Scripts and should now download it to the GitHub desktop application. (see help below)\r\n\r\n## 3. How can I download the repository to my computer\r\nFirstly you have to have the [GitHub Desktop Application](https://desktop.github.com/) installed on your computer. GitHub knows that this has been installed and creates an icon inside your version of the TamperMonkey Scripts repository. Make sure you are viewing your TamperMonkey repository and click the download button.\r\n![Click to GitHub Desktop ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibettison/tamperMonkey/master/Download.PNG)\r\nThis copies the repository contents to you computer and should copy it to the default location on your H: drive - H:\\GitHub\\TamperMonkey.\r\n\r\n## 4. How do I keep the script up to date\r\nOk! If I make any changes to the code and upload them to GitHub your script will automatically update without any need for you to do anything. Just check the **Script Update** settings in settings and make sure the check interval is NOT set to 'Never'.\r\n\r\n## 5. How do I change the Header Details\r\nYou need to go into [GitHub](https://github.com/) on the internet and select the file _headerDetails.user.js_, there is a **pencil icon** at the top of the viewing window that allows you to edit the file. \r\n![Click to Edit ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibettison/tamperMonkey/master/Edit.PNG)\r\nTo save the file you need to type a description as to why the file was changed then you can click the _Commit Changes button_.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 6. I've made additional changes to the Header Details but they're not showing when I add a Canned Answer\r\nTamperMonkey Caches the external files it uses within the scripts and you need to change a setting in the Settings options to make TamperMonkey re-cache the external Header Details file. In Settings find the _**Externals**_ option and change the setting to _'Always'_.\r\n\r\nRun the script once then change this setting back to _'Every Week'_ or _'Every Month'_ or _'Never'_ the Externals will only change if you change the Header Details.\r\n\r\n## 7. Everything is working but how do I use the script in NUService\r\n<<Coming Soon>>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
